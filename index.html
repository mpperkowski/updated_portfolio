      <h1>Story of Ups and Downs</h1>

      <p>My name is Mark and this isn't the employer ready competitive
        portfolio... yet. My life has it's ups and downs and well... 
        you know you have a problem when after having an unstable life
        of going into massive debt, then making money, foolishly giving
        it it away or being a big spender, losing your money again, and
        then borrow money again, and then going down a <strong>spiral of
        depression</strong></p>

      <p>It took me 5 years of college to get a Bachelor's and well I 
        paid off my student loans, but I never really had a conventional 
        9 to 5 job. I did everything to avoid it. After working around
        here and there, I looked at all lucrative oppurtunities to get by.
        I never dabbled in anything that broke that law, and have a clean 
        record when it comes to the government and law enforcement.
      </p>

      <p>Being 25 years old, I have my parents health insurance plan until
        I turn 26, and well to cut to the chase. I am admitting to a TA
        grading my HW, which will be updated after the due date, that I 
        had a severe <strong>drug and alcohol addiction</strong>, and well after getting a
        free pass with Bitcoin tripling in price, I was able to pay off 90%
        of people I shouldn't have borrowed money from. I also want to join the
        regular workforce without being stuck with a crappy job, so I decided 
        to do the bootcamp <strong>instead of going to rehab.</strong> So for me
        this bootcamp is my rehab, and well withdrawal is a pain. This sucks
        I really want to focus, I just have to get rid of people in my past.
